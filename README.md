Hey there Welcome to UMehrajCodes, I am an aspiring DevOps Engineer with an interest in Automation, Cloud Technologies, and CI/CD Tools. 

I am currently learning/implementing Ansible, AWS, and Jenkins into my workflow at work and my home lab environment. 

During my downtime, I focus on my hobbies such as Sports, Gaming, and Web Development. 

This is a start of journey, and every journey begins with a first step. This is my First Step towards that journey ðŸ™‚

You can reach me at .... Work in Progress
